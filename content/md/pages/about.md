My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander living in Sydney, Australia. My wife [@amcamr](http://twitter.com/amcamr) and I moved here after a few years in Melbourne, preceeded by ~6 years in the UK. We have 2x little kids too. They're awesome.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in startups, telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, and systems for small/medium business. I'm also into functional programming, both typed and dynamic, and particularly enjoy Clojure.

I work for a company called [BeeCastle](https://beecastle.com). We make a B2B SaaS relationship analytics product for high-trust, relationship lead sales. Think laywers, financial advisors, consultants. People who sell on the basis of relationship and referrals rather that outbound marketing campaigns and sales automation.

I have a long history in technology and consulting, with senior leadership roles in startups and consulting organisations, as well as architecture and technology strategy within global telcos. I've also run my own consultancy, providing mobile product design and development.

I'm [@rickerbh](http://twitter.com/rickerbh) on Twitter - you should follow me.
