My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander who has recently moved back home to Christchurch, New Zealand after about 20 years away. During that time we've been living in Auckland, Reading (UK), Melbourne, and Sydney. We have 2x little kids too. They're awesome.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in startups, telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, and systems for small/medium business. I'm also into functional programming, both typed and dynamic, and particularly enjoy Clojure.

I work as CTO for a company called [BeeCastle](https://beecastle.com). We make an MSP focussed B2B SaaS sales analytics product that help MSPs make more money. It analyses product and sales data across an MSP's customer base, and helps them understand where sales opportunities lie. It also helps maintaining strong relationships with customers to reduce churn through automated interaction tracking. I have a long history in technology and consulting, with senior leadership roles in startups and consulting organisations, as well as architecture and technology strategy within global telcos. I've also run my own consultancy, providing mobile application design and development.

I've invested in a few tech startups, through both managed funds and direct.
