My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander based in Christchurch, New Zealand but have been out of the country most of my working life. I've got 25+ years technology industry experience. During that time I've been living in Auckland, Reading (UK), Melbourne, and Sydney. My wife and I have 2x kids. They're awesome.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in startups, telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, and systems for small/medium business. I'm also into functional programming, both typed and dynamic, and particularly enjoy Clojure.

I work as Director, Technology for a company called [Simple Machines](https://simplemachines.com.au). We're a data engineering consultancy, specialising in helping organisations build and scale their data infrastructure. In my role I manage projects and accounts typically related to AI and Data Mesh. Prior to this I was CTO at a relationship and sales analytics startup. I have a long history in technology and consulting, with senior leadership roles in startups and consulting organisations, as well as architecture and technology strategy within global telcos. I've also run my own consultancy, providing mobile application design and development.

I've invested in a few tech startups, through both managed funds and direct.
