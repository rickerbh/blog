Progress on the 1000km is good so far. 109km run in Jan, and I'm sticking to the 10km distance per run. Weight is also starting to fall, which is great because I'm about 9kg heavier than I should be.

Because I'm also a nerd (and if you're reading my blog, you probably are too), here's a graph marking progress. Grey line is what I need to run to get to 1000km this year. Any blue higher than the grey line is kms in the bank for a rainy day.
