Progress has been a bit slower this month. Short month, very hot here, and new baby all contributed to slowing progress down. Oh, in other news, we now have a baby!  Exciting.

190km complete at end of Feb, which leaves me with a 30km buffer. The last graph was a little incorrect too - Numbers only puts dates correctly (in relative terms) on the x-axis if the graph type is a scatterplot. Dumb. The new graph below is correct.
