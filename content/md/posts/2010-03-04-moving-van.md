Yesterday when I came home <a href="http://is.gd/93SaG">Moving Van's</a> sales were up. I was a bit surprised as I hadn't done any specific marketing for the app, and what was really odd is that they were only up for the UK.  A little investigation and I discover that <a href="http://is.gd/93SaG">Moving Van</a> has been featured as "New and Noteworthy" in the iTunes Store UK.

How frickin' exciting!
