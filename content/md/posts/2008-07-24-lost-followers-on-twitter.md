Twitter seems to be having some <a href="http://www.badlydrawntoy.com/2008/07/24/twitter-lost-followers/" target="_blank">issues</a>, well, more issues than normal.  I was surprised to not get any updates on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Twitterrific on my iphone</a> today, so though I'd check out what was going down on their site.  It appears that I've lost all of the people I was following, and all of my followers.  A quick check with some of the followers as well, and they've lost all their contacts.

Come on Twitter, what's going on?
