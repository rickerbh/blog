<div><div><p>I&#8217;m <em>very nearly</em> there.  I received Entry Clearance from the British High Commission in NZ here today, so that&#8217;s cool.  Now I just need flights sorted and I&#8217;m gone.  I&#8217;m hoping to leave <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/193970">Christchurch</a> in a couple of days (less than 48 hours), have a couple of nights in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/104898">Auckland</a>, and then wing my way to sunny <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/105698">Newbury</a> (via <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/269267">Heathrow Airport</a>).  I hope to hear back soon on how we&#8217;re going to sort these flights.  They are provided as part of my transfer, and of course, I get to go business class.  And I&#8217;m a platinum level frequent flyer, and my points are about to expire &#8211; so I&#8217;m hoping whichever member of the OneWorld alliance I fly with has the good sence to give me a first class upgrade &#8211; you know, for being a good customer :-)</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1827180">move to another country</a></div></div>
