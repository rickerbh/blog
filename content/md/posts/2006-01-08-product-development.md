<div>
<div>Yesterday on the plane back from my holiday in Christchurch, I finished the functional aspects of my application that I'm developing.Today, I made it aesthetically pleasing.  The application is ready for testing.  I'm going to ask my friend Yanti who works for Unisys as a tester in Wellington to test the application out. 

There are some things I need to do as well.
<ul>
	<li>Go see an accountant about company structures</li>
	<li>Go and get a terms of service statement from a lawyer</li>
	<li>Find a CMS to help me maintain a â€œbusinessâ€ web site</li>
	<li>Find a product name.</li>
</ul>
That's about it really.  Shouldn't be too hard to finish this off.
