I ordered an <a href="https://www.zagg.com/invisibleshield/apple-iphone-3g-cases-screen-protectors-covers-skins-shields.php" target="_blank">invisibleSHIELD </a>from <a href="http://www.zagg.com" target="_blank">zagg.com </a>for my iPhone 3G today - and they gave me 2x discount codes for 20% off in their online store.  I don't need them, so I'm posting them below.  If they don't work (they are one use only) let me know and I'll post a comment saying they're gone.

Oh, and with the 20% discount, free shipping to the UK and Europe, and the strength of the pound, I got it for around 50% of the purchase price at <a href="http://www.easyishop.co.uk/" target="_blank">easyishop</a>.
