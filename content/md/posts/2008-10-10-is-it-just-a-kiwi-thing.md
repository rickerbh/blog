Air New Zealand has recently launched a new campaign.  What makes me chuckle, and angry is the folllowing ad:

<a href="http://airnewzealandpromotions.com/is-it-just-a-kiwi-thing_files/ad-mel.htm"><img src="http://content3.rm04.net/ra/2008/10/10/2220978/consumer_edm_files_profile_mel.jpg.jpg" alt="Air NZ Ad" /></a>

My response:  If you say I can demand it during take-off and landing, why did I have to fly for around 26 hours with you people and have no on-demand service, after the flight was delayed for around 13 hours?  

I guess that's what you get when your national operator turns into a what is effectively a budget airline.  Never flying Air New Zealand again.
