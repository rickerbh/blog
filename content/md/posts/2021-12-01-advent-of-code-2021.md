I try to do at least some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles each year. Usually I get a few days in then other pressures come up and I have to bail, but I use the puzzles as an opportunity to try out programming languages that are new to me, or ones I want to become more familiar with. Last year I attempted to use OCaml. This went OK for a couple of days, but then we moved internationally and were locked in a hotel room for 2 weeks with young kids, so AoC was the first thing to go out the window.

This year I'm looking to use [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) again to solve the puzzles - I didn't give it a fair shake last year. I've had a bit of experience with ML-style languages via Haskell, so I'm hoping the learning curve isn't too steep.

I'm terrible at keeping on top of this blog, but I'd like to document the process I go through with learning this language via the puzzles.

Stay tuned.
