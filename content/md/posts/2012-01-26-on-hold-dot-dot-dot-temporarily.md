I had some great news last week. A previous client asked me to submit a quote for the full version of a prototype iOS app I had created for him last year. I submitted the proposal, but had assumed he was using it to benchmark other application development companies against. To my surprise, he accepted my proposal, and awarded me the work. It's a substantial piece of work, and technically quite challenging. It also has the potential to be a big innovation on the space it's in, so is exciting from that aspect too.

So, I accepted. The issue for me is that this puts my other project on hold for a few months. However, income is good, and this will let me work for longer on my project after I'm done, so it's a positive move.
