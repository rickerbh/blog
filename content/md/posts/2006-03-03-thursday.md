<div><div><p>I went out last night and talked to a relative stranger for about 4 hours.  Was good.  I&#8217;m sure the wine helped :-)  Actually, it was probably the good social skills of my poor victim.  I usually struggle to make small-talk &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t really be belittling the conversation I was having by calling it small talk.  It wasn&#8217;t small.  It was talk, chat, get to know you kind of stuff.  I really enjoyed myself.  Might do that again.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1897622">become better at small-talk</a></div></div>
