<div>
<div>Got my ticket yesterday!  It's on here in Auckland on Friday.  I'm quite excited.  My picks:
<ul>
	<li>The White Stripes</li>
 
	<li>Franz Ferdinand</li>
 
	<li>Gerling</li>
 
	<li>Iggy and the Stooges (!)</li>
 
	<li>Fat Freddys Drop</li>
 
	<li>Magic Numbers (got their album â€œMagic Numbersâ€ this week â€“ outstanding!)</li>
 
	<li>Concord Dawn (sorry Mylo, but I'm a massive fan of Concord Dawn)</li>
 
	<li>Shapeshifter</li>
 
	<li>Sola Rosa</li>
 </ul>
 

I don't think I can fit it all inâ€¦  There will be clashes.  I've also got friends coming up from Wellington to go to it, and I haven't even factored in what they want to seeâ€¦
