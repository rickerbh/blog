[Three years](http://jacquesmattheij.com/It+takes+three+years+to+build+a+business) eh? I'm planning 6 months.

I guess the key difference here is that I'm not planning on having any employees at 6 months. I don't plan on being able to replace the lucrative contracting I've been doing either. In fact, I don't really expect any sales at 6 months. 

What I am aiming for is to have a software product that I believe has a future. If, 6 months in, I have something that I can start to sell and get feedback on, I'll be a very happy man.
