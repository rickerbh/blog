<div><div><p>...with a friend from New Zealand a couple of days ago.  I hadn&#8217;t heard from or seen him since October 2006, and it was good to hear from him.  I had to do some digging as I had an old email address, but I found a newer one and things are good.</p>	<p>ALSO, I&#8217;m going to London tonight (assuming I&#8217;m feeling better  by mid afternoon) to see a couple of old friends.  One I saw about 6 or so weeks ago, but one I haven&#8217;t seen in nearly 7 years.  It&#8217;ll be cool to catch up with her again.</p>	<p>I really like finding out what people are up to, I think I might have to keep on top of this goal, recontacting people, restablishing friendship &#8211; it&#8217;s great.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1827211">strengthen, reestablish, and nurture my existing friendships</a></div></div>
