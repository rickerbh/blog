Apple have added an extra attribute to applications on iTunes store - keywords.

You can configure your keywords with the "Edit Information" link against the application.  <a href="http://sendit4.me">SendIt4.me</a> (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=302871160&mt=8&s=143441">iTMS</a>) has already been updated :-)

Be careful though.  It appears you can only update your keywords ONCE per application update - so make sure you choose the right ones the first time around - otherwise you'll have to go through the painful approvals process to get it corrected.

The keywords <em>should</em> help with searching for your application within the store.  Fingers crossed.

--- EDIT ---

You can also only have up to 100 characters for the keywords.  Don't get caught out!  If you submit with more than 100, it tells you too late - you'll have to resubmit your app to fix it.
