Good stuff on this vinyl.  The reason why I got a set of Dntel is because the guy collaborated with another guy for â€œThe Postal Serviceâ€, whom I absolutely love.  I think the story goes that the Dntel guy did the tracks, and the other guy did the vocals â€“ or perhaps the other way around.  Anyway, Vynalogica 1 is pretty good.  The 2nd track features vocals, the 3rd is relatively experimental â€“ but very good.  It reminds me a bit of Mum or Boards of Canada in places, and the vocal track is quite Postal Service.

Recommended.
