I received a package I ordered from <a href="http://zazzle.com" target="_blank">Zazzle</a> today and it contained some discount vouchers that I won't be using.  Codes below - tell me if they don't work so I can update the post to show they are gone.
<ul>
	<li>$10 (USD I assume) orders of over $10 or more - expiring 31st Dec 2008 - <strong>ZAZZLE10GIFTAYJTRYRM</strong> and <strong>ZAZZLE10GIFTDFWCINBI</strong></li>
	<li>$5 off purchase of $50 or more (I reckon this is multi-use) expiring 18th Jan 2009 - <strong>ZAZZLEWINTER</strong></li>
</ul>
Enjoy!
