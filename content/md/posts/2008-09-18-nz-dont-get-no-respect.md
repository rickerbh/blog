I've recently transferred some funds internationally.  To do this I needed a special account code so that the bank I'm sending money to know which of the accounts they hold should receive it.  This number is a conventional looking account number, prefixed with a country code, and a checksum value.  There is also a website that checks them - <a href="http://www.apacs.org.uk/payments_industry/ibans_5.html">http://www.apacs.org.uk/payments_industry/ibans_5.html</a>

Putting in a country that they can't check the actual account number for causes their little javascript application to unleash a serious dissing.

Ouch!

BTW - Sorry for the Rodney Dangerfield knock-off quote.  He's awful.
