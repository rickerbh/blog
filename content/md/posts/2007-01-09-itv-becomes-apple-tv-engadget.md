This is a device I was excited about, but now, meh.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/itv-becomes-apple-tv/">iTV becomes Apple TV</a>

No 1080 High Def???

<em>Only</em> 40Gb HD???

I like that you can connect computers to it to pull the media, but why a restriction of 5?  Seems arbitrary to me (similar to the restriction within the Airport Express).  A big question I have is does it stream media out, or does it support file based access over the wireless?  I'd rather it just acted as a big hard drive for your computers, and streamed out (played) to the TV.  But 40Gb?  I can't get over that.  That's nothing.

--- EDIT ---

Reading the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/">keynote</a>, it appears that the 5 computers are used as a source for Apple TV.  And it appears you can sync data to it like an iPod (supporting smart playlists and everything).  $299 USD, shipping in Feb.
