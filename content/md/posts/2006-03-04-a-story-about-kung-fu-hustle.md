Got this out yesterday (I also hired The Experiment and Ripleys Game â€“ so they'll be watched soon).

This movie is fantastic.  I don't believe I've ever laughed at a single movie so much.  It was the cheesy lines, and ridiculous stereotypes that made me laugh.  There is some mighty impressive fighting (as you'd expect), and some <em>astounding</em> special effects.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this â€“ and recommend it to all.  I wouldn't say it's a good introductory movie to the martial arts genre (because of the westernised cheesy-ness â€“ it might give you the wrong impression for the rest of the genre), but if you're into that scene it's great.
