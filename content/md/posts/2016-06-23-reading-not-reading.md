I recently finished a book called [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://www.bookdepository.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns/9780596518387?a_aid=rickerbh) (more on why later) and one of the things it suggested is keeping an online list of books you read, and books you want to read. So here is mine.

I'm going to add a few more books to the read list as well - ones I think other people may be interested in. 

If you've got any recommendations please let me know in the comments or on Twitter - [@rickerbh](http://twitter.com/rickerbh)
