<div><div><p>My USB controller on my &#8220;movies&#8221; drive crapped out, so I went and got another one.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve now got my media split between the 2 drives &#8211; all video on one, all music on the other.  It&#8217;s great.  I&#8217;ve just got some photos to organise, and my hard drive is officially cleaned up.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2348711">clean up my hard drive</a></div></div>
