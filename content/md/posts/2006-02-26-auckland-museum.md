Went to the Museum here today.  I was astounded.  It is so very good.  I've been living here for just over 6 years now and had never been.  My mate Dave asked me if I wanted to go to see the Da Vinci machines exhibition and I am quite keen to see that.  Anyway, I met him down at Santos (a local cafe), we had a late lunch, bit of a chat then made our way down to the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  We arrived down there at about 3.  After a quick chat to the guy who was taking the $5 donation to get in, we discovered that the line for the exhibition was about 1 hour long...  So, we decided to have a look around the rest of the place then check out the line again.  It's a very good museum.  Anyway, we were having a look around, about a 1/3 of the way around the 3rd floor they announced that the place was closing in 5 minutes.  We didn't even get to see the whole place.  Anyway, I'd be quite keen to go back, and the Da Vinci machines closes on the 5th of March.  It has late night on Wednesday, so perhaps that's a plan for after work.<br /><br />I've gotta check out more places of cultural significance in this city.  I think next on the list will be the Art Gallery.
