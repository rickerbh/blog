<div><div><p>I&#8217;m moving here!  It&#8217;s pretty big news.</p>	<p>On the 20th of August I&#8217;m moving out of Newbury, into my new flatshare with 2 others (who seem VERY nice people) in Caversham, Reading.  I&#8217;m very excited about it all actually, I get to almost maximise my free company provided accommodation, and then I get to move into a nice, tidy flat, with fun, friendly people.</p>	<p>Woohoo!</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43places.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=4099433">Caversham</a></div></div>
