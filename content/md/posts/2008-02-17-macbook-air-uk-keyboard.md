Arrrrgggg!

When I ordered my MacBook Air the only options I had for keyboard were UK English, and French.  No US English when ordering from the UK store you see.  So, I was trying to hack around with rcov today, and needed to alter some source.  I wanted to copy and edit a line of code, preserving the original.  To do this, I was just going to hash out the line, and put my altered line below.  That's where I encountered my issue.

THE UK KEYBOARD LAYOUT HAS NO # SYMBOL PRINTED ON IT!!!!

Luckily I found <a href="http://www.hutsby.net/2008/01/apple-mac-osx-looking-for-hash-on-uk.html">this</a> page - Hat tip to QuiteTall.

<strong>ALT-3</strong> for people who can't be bothered clicking thru.

I mean come on - the keyboard has symbols such as § and ±, but no #?!?!?!?  What's going on with that?
