This movie is amazing.  Brilliant soundtrack by RZA of Wu-Tang fame, some beautiful camera shots, and a compelling story.  I love how <a href="http://www.43people.com/profile/view/114178">Jarmusch</a> has crossed over Samurai code to mafia hit men, and how he shows the dedication that Ghost Dog has for his art, belief structure and warrior code.

I really enjoyed it.
