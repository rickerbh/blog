<div><div><p>I just bought a beautiful alarm clock.  I wanted a small clock, that I could take travelling, and it needed to be an functional, yet fantastic piece of design work.  So, I was out with <a href="http://annemareec.43people.com/">AMC</a> + <a href="http://jenna1.43people.com/">Jenna</a> and stumbled across <a href="http://www.designstore.com/roalcl.html">this</a> fantastic device.  It was designed by flemming bo hansen in 2002, and is made by Rosendahl.</p>	<p><img src="http://www.aboutstyle.com.au/sub/images/jarass/rosendahl/P3201cube_alarm.jpg" alt="" /></p>	<p>It has adjustable snooze, and has a backlit LCD (only when you press on the top) so it won&#8217;t keep you awake with the light at night.  It&#8217;s a bit pricy, but I consider it a design icon, and it met all of my criteria that I had in mind.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=3668208">Buy an alarm clock</a></div></div>
