<div><div><p>...about half of my clothes (all donated to a charity to raise funds for breast cancer research), and a whole stack of paper from my employer, health insurance, life insurance, banks etc&#8230;</p>	<p>I feel much lighter because of it.  The relative bareness of my wardrobe is freaking me out a bit.</p>	<p>I&#8217;m probably going to try to sell my coffee table, my bookshelf, and my large couch (2.5m long, 4 seater) this week.  I have to think about the couch actually.  I don&#8217;t know if I want to get rid of it or not.  I really like it, but I&#8217;m not going to have a need for it for a while.  I might see if someone I know and trust wants it for a bit.  It&#8217;s a very nice couch.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2682480">get rid of unnecessary possessions</a></div></div>
