hehehe.  I really enjoy rock bands fronted by women (eg, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=Elastica&amp;product=album">elastica</a>, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=garbage&amp;product=album">garbage</a>, <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=veruca+salt&amp;product=album">veruca salt</a>), but have only really listened to british chick rock, not really american.  I understand Morningwood come from New York, they are a 4 piece rock band with a female singer.

My favourite 2 tracks off this album are â€œNth Degreeâ€ â€“ which is the single I heard on Juice here (one of our MTV-type channels) and â€œJetsetterâ€.

The music has a very new wave and punk type feel about it â€“ which kind of explains why I like it so much.  Also, Nth Degree (for me at least) has a similar feel to some of the <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=Saint+Etienne&amp;product=album">Saint Etienne</a> tracks off <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/61921">Good Humor</a>.

Anyway, I'm super impressed by these guys.  I hope they get the airplay they deserve.
