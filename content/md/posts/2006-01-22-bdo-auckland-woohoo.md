I made it.  It was fantastic.  Saw lots of bands, got a little messed up, got home very late, got to sleep <em>much</em> later.

My favourite acts that I saw:
<strong>P-Money â€“ amazing mixin'n'scratch'n.  I didn't even plan on going, Yanti convinced me.
</strong>Franz Ferdinand
*2 Many DJs

 

Fantastic day â€“ thanks to Sarah, Steve, George, Johnny, and Yanti for joining me :-)  I had a blast.
