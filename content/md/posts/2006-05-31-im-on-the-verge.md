<div>
<div>...of starting up a company, but I need a name.  I've got my product developed and the product name sorted, but I need a name for the company that developed it (ie, me).There are some things I'm looking for in the name.Â 
<ol>
	<li>The .com address must be available.</li>
	<li>The name should evoke feelings of simplicity, usability, affordability, accessability.</li>
	<li>The name should reflect a level of professionalism and security.</li>
</ol>
Of course, I'll be happy with pretty much anything that is average on the 2nd and 3rd points, but the .com address MUST be available.

Any ideas?
