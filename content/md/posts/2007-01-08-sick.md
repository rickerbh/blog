I'm off work sick today.  It really hit me yesterday, I was feeling so crappy last night, and today is sort of on par, but I get the sense I'm getting better.  Although this does give me the opportunity to catch up on some feeds that I haven't looked at in a bit. 

I seem to be sneezing a lot, and have runny nose, and a headache, and blocked sinuses.  I put getting sick down to my last couple of weeks of drinking a lot, not eating well and not sleeping much.  I think being generally run down has taken its toll on my immunity, and now I'm paying the price. 

I wonder if I'll ever learn.
