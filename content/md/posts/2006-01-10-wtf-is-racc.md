racc is the rubyised implementation of lex/yacc.  I want to learn this as I've got some file parsing that needs doing, and this is the <em>proper</em> way to parse files.  It's a lot of guesswork at the momentâ€¦
Check <a href="http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc/">http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc/</a> to see what I'm on about.
