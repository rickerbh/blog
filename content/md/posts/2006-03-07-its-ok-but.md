...only 3 stars from me.  The album just didn't gel with me like I expected it to.  I haven't listened to any of Isobel Campbell's music outside of B&amp;S, and I guess I was perhaps expecting something different.

The music coupled with Mark Lanegans vocals struck me as very Nick Cave-esque.  It could have just been because they have similar voices.

Anyway, I didn't find anything particularly exciting about this album.  I'm going to listen to it a couple more time though, to give it a fair go.  I really <em>do</em> want to enjoy Isobels music.
