I found it quite boring, I felt no suspense, or thrill from it.  It wasn&#8217;t scary.  I&#8217;m quite disappointed.  There were some very odd shots in the movie, my guess is that they are probably reminiscent of the original.  The reason I say that is that some of the shots felt very hitchcock-esque, and I find often old murder/mystery/thrillers have that sort of feeling.  I will try to watch the original, see if I enjoy that more.</p></div><div><a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/person/rickerbh/152805"><br />See more about Cape Fear</a></div></div>
