<div><div><p>...with Vodafone Group Services, as part of Global IT in Newbury, England.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m starting on the 15th May.  Quite quick really.  I think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to be doing telecommunications system design for 18+ countries or something.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty big deal for me actually.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very pleased.</p> <p>Should be out of Auckland sometime early May, and in the UK around the 10th of May I think.  HavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got flights yet.  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all part of the organisation around the transfer that I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got done yet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m waiting for Group to get the written confirmation of my acceptance and then the transfer company apparently contact me.</p> <p>Woohoo!</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1872113">get a job in europe</a></div></div>
