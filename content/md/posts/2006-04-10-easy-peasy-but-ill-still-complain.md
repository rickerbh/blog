<div><div><p>It only costs me $20, and a passport sized photo.  All the information that a New Zealander needs is available at the <a href="http://www.aa.co.nz/motoring/Section?Action=View&#38;Section_id=47&#38;Story_id=1038">AA</a>.  However, I will make one complaint &#8211; the AA charge you $20 to go in and process it manually in store, $30 if you post it in (cause of course its more expensive for them to open an envelope rather than have the entire infrastructure of a building for me to wait in), and $40 to handle an online application, where I do all the work (scanning drivers license, and photos), and they just print the stuff out &#8211; they receive the data on a file server, and don&#8217;t even need to open an envelope.</p>	<p>Way to embrace the digital age, slackers.  That sort of stuff just makes me angry.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2682570">get an international driver's license</a></div></div>
