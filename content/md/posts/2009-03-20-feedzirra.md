<a href="http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/tree/master">Feedzirra</a> is an RSS feed fetching and parsing library that I quite like.  For a project I'm working on with a mate we need to be able to parse and receive updates from (potentially) a large number of RSS feeds.  Feedzirra seemed the ticket, but didn't have support for itunes style RSS feeds - so I added it.  

This was basically my first (well, second, but that wasn't public) go with github, and first contribution to an open source project.  <a href="http://www.pauldix.net/2009/03/feedzirra-release-adds-simple-custom-parsing-and-more.html">Paul Dix accepted my code</a>, and I'm oddly excited about it all.

AND to make things even better, someone has already started to enhance my contribution.  Woo hoo!
