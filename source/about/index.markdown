My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander living in Sydney, Australia. My wife [@amcamr](http://twitter.com/amcamr) and I recently moved here after a couple of years in Melbourne, preceeded by ~6 years in the UK. We have a little kid too. He's awesome.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, small business systems, and all things Apple.

I work for a company called [Simple Machines](http://simplemachines.com.au). We do complex systems engineering, mobile applications, product design, UX, and graphic design. Think banking, gaming, ticketing. High performance, high scalability, big data analytics.

I'm [@rickerbh](http://twitter.com/rickerbh) on Twitter - you should follow me.
