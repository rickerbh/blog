My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander living in Reading in the United Kingdom. My wife [@mrsrickerby](http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby) and I are about to embark on a new adventure and relocate to Melbourne, Australia. It's all very exciting.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, small business systems, and all things Apple.

I run a company called [Glimmer Design](http://glimmerdesign.com) that provides consulting services in Mobile Telecommunications and iOS (iPhone, iPad) Applications. We release iPhone, iPad and Mac applications under the [Glimmer Design](http://glimmerdesign.com) as well as the [happtic](http://happtic.com/) brands. We work with clients of all sizes, from FTSE-100 companies down to private individuals. [Get in touch](mailto:contact@glimmerdesign.com) if you'd like to discuss a project.

I'm [@rickerbh](http://twitter.com/rickerbh) on Twitter - you should follow me.
