My name is Hamish Rickerby. Iâ€™m a New Zealander living in Melbourne, Australia. My wife [@mrsrickerby](http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby) and I recently moved here after 5+ years in the UK.

I'm interested in technology in general, but particularly in telecommunications, usage of IT systems in healthcare, small business systems, and all things Apple.

I run a company called [happtic](http://happtic.com) that creates iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Mac Applications. We release iPhone, iPad and Mac applications under the [Glimmer Design](http://glimmerdesign.com) as well as the [happtic](http://happtic.com/) brands. We work with clients of all sizes, from FTSE-100 companies down to private individuals. [Get in touch](mailto:contact@happtic.com) if you'd like to discuss a project.

I'm [@rickerbh](http://twitter.com/rickerbh) on Twitter - you should follow me.
