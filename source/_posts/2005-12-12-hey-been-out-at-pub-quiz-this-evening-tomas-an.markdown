Hey.  Been out at <a href='http://www.dogsbollixirishbar.co.nz'>pub quiz</a> this evening.  Tomas and me.  We got last.  We suck so much.  Lost by 5 points.  Couldn't answer any of the first 7 questions - bloody current affairs, and local sports.  Why do I pay so little attention to local sports.  It's really because I just don't care about how local team x is going against foreign team y.  Proletariats and their distractions I guess.  And then we stayed for the open mic night.  First lady was depressing, 2nd dude was alright.  3rd dude was this freaky modern beatnik poet - so random.  4th was this dude who was quite good.  last we saw was this lady who's stage demeanor was equivalent to that of Jewel.  She was a really good singer too.  I['d buy her CD if she released one.<p>Tomas and Jon went off to the Drake.  I went home.  I've got a conference call with VFUK in the morning (urrrg, 7-am) about a job.  Fingers crossed.<p>I'm a bit boozed.
