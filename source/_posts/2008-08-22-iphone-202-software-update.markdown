Apple released <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/" target="_blank">this update</a>Â a day or two ago.  I installed it yesterday morning.

Unhappy customer.

Since then, I've had worse performance on transition to the SMS and contacts screen.  I've also had issues when listening to music and receiving email/sms at the same time.  Sometimes the music fades out and then stops, and I need to tap the round button at the bottom to make it go again, sometimes the music just halts (no fade), I head the new email sound, then music starts up again.

I've noticed nothing good about this update.
