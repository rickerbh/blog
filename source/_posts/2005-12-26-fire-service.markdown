I went out to the Christchurch International Airport today, and got to see the fire engines...  There are about 5  big engines down there.  Got to go for a ride on one of the runways in the fancy new engine - $1.2m purchase price, around $300k commissioning cost.  It carries around 10k litres of water.  The main water cannon can shoot water up to 70 metres.  VERY impressive.  I got to control the cannons - that was quite cool.  They were surprisingly responsive.  There are a couple of joysticks - one for the nose mounted cannon, and one for the top mounted one.  Very good.<p>The new truck has around 680hp, and weighs 33 tonnes.  It has quite good acceleration given its weight.<p>Big thanks to Richard and his father for letting me go out there.<p>Pictures on <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/'>flickr</a>.
