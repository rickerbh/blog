<div><div><p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the Art Nouveau movement &#8211; organic forms, writhing plants, all that sort of thing.   The backlash by art against the industrial revolution and all that&#8230;  Anyway, my background for my phone sort of reflects that.</p>	<p>It&#8217;s actually a piece of art produced by the good lads from <a href="http://sigur-ros.co.uk">Sigur Ros</a>.  Whilst not strictly Art Nouveau, it was a multi-media production (photos modified with <em>Natural</em> products), and has a feeling and emotion about it that I quite like and can identify with.  Please see it below.</p>	<p><img src="http://download.sigur-ros.co.uk/art/cover-usa-small.jpg" alt="" /></p>	<p>I&#8217;m actually really keen to get my powerbook acid etched with some sort of vine and leaves motif, but am a bit worried about getting it wrong.  I really don&#8217;t want a horrible looking powerbook.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2042791">pimp out my phone</a></div></div>
