<div><div><p>Shoe Science came thru.  Even delivered early.  I only went in yesterday morning, and the correct size arrived for me this morning.  What service!  Anyway, I just tried them out.  The salesgirl in the store suggested I run about half of the usual distance I run for in them, as I need to get used to the different shoes.  They certainly are more comfortable than my last &#8220;running&#8221; shoes, and my legs don&#8217;t hurt now either.  Top.  If you&#8217;re interested, they are the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 6.  Blue and silver.  Not that nasty yellow and silver.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1878114">buy proper running shoes</a></div></div>
