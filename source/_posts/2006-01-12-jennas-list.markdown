My friend Jenna is doing an Honours degree at the university of Canterbury.  She is taking some film papers, and seems to be quite a cinemophile (did I just make up a word?).  When I was down there she was shocked at the lack of movie watching I did, so I committed to her that I would watch a list of movies that she's given me.
FWIW, the list is here.  If there's a movie you think should be on it, let me know and I'll pitch it to her for adding.
