Frickin brilliant.  I loved this movie.  I knew nothing about it going into it, it was on the list and I spotted it first at the movie store.  The score is so good â€“ I have a nice home theater system and Franks voice kept coming out behind me, freaked me out.  There are some intensely beautiful scenes in this movie â€“ I'm quite a fan of <em>beautiful</em> movies.  The concept of the story is excellent, the end where everything ties together was perhaps a touch predictable â€“ but then again I seem to have a knack for picking the twists in movies (I picked the twist in â€œThe Usual Suspectsâ€ about 30 minutes into the movie), but it was thoroughly enjoyable.

 

9/10.  I was torn between 9 and 10 of 10.

 

9 down, 57 DVD's left.
