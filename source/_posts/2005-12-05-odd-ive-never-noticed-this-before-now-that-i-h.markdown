Odd, I've never noticed this before.  Now that I have it's obvious.<p>I got some food out of the freezer before to cook for dinner, I closed the freezer, and it started hissing at me.   "ssssssssssssss" it was saying.  I thought that was a bit strange, and opened it to see what was creating the noise, and the noise stopped.  I closed it again, and it started to make the noise again.  About 1/4 of a second later I concluded that this was the sound of air getting inside it.  This is the obvious bit, but had I not heard it, I would not have thought about this _ever_.  When I open the freezer, warmer air from the kitchen gets inside, raising the temperature of the freezer.  When I shut the door, the warmer air cools down, and the molecules vibrate less, and the air "contracts".  This leaves a vacuum, which air from outside the fridge comes and fills - I'm assuming because of possibly dodgy seals on the fridge.<p>Well, that's my new learning for the day.
