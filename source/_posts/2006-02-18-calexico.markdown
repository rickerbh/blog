On my trip to wellington last weekend Johnny (the younger brother of a friend I was staying with) suggested I might want to check out <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=calexico&amp;product=album">Calexico</a>.  I got a hold of 2 of their albums, one is a joint effort with <a href="http://allconsuming.net/search/query?q=iron+%26+wine&amp;product=album">Iron and Wine</a> (who I also really like a lot), and the other is Calexico alone.

If you're into folk guitar type sounds (Iron and Wine, Belle &amp; Sebastian [twee pop â€“ but a similar sound]), Sufjan Stevens etc) I can highly recommend <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/51390">In The Reins</a>.  The album <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item/view/62745">Feast of Wire</a> was a more interesting mix, which I'm lead to understand is more core Calexico.  Jazz, Afro-Latin, and acoustic guitar blend with beautiful voices to create a masterpiece.  I'm quite impressed.
