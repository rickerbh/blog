I am having a bit of a play with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cocos2d-iphone/">cocos2d</a> game engine for iPhone and encountered a very strange error in the console - I don't believe it's at all related to the game engine itself, so it's just coincidence that I was trying something new out.

error while killing target (killing anyway): warning: error on line 1987 of "/SourceCache/gdb/gdb-962/src/gdb/macosx/macosx-nat-inferior.c" in function "macosx_kill_inferior_safe": (os/kern) failure (0x5x)

I figured out that it had to do with definition of a selector...  Naughty code below.

``` objective-c
MenuItem *start = [MenuItemFont itemFromString:@"Start Game"
                                        target:self
                                      selector:@selector(startGame)];
```


The problem is that the method name inside @selector() MUST have a colon on the back of it.

Good code

``` objective-c
MenuItem *start = [MenuItemFont itemFromString:@"Start Game"
                                        target:self
                                      selector:@selector(startGame:)];
```

Hope that's useful to someone.
