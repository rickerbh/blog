I saw this â€“ I don't remember if I added it, or if Jenna added it.  Anyway, this was one of the most beautiful movies I've seen.  Absolutely stunning.  Visual masterpiece â€“ my eyes were hardly worthy.  The soundtrack is perfect as well.

It appears that it was pretty windy in China 2000 years ago â€“ their hair is always blowing around whilst they are fighting ;-)

I thought the story was actually a bit weak, and in some places I found it a bit difficult to follow.  The concept for the story was OK I guess, but the execution was a little poor IMHO.  However, the stunning camera and scene work more than made up for it.

Based on the visuals and soundtrack alone I recommend it.
