I spent the day reworking <a title="Glimmer Design" href="http://glimmerdesign.com">Glimmer Design</a>.  I always intended to - the template I had on there was good, but not quite what I was after.  I had a think last week about what I'd like the site to look like, and I made it today.

 

Homepage

<a href="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gd.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-235" title="Glimmer Design" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gd-300x182.png" alt="Glimmer Design homepage" width="300" height="182" /></a>

 

And the page behind the spanner (yes! that's what it's supposed to be)

<a href="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gd-work.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-234" title="Glimmer Design | Work" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gd-work-300x185.png" alt="Examples of the work done by Glimmer Design" width="300" height="185" /></a>

There are 2 things that concern me

 
<ol>
	<li>People's browser windows may not be big enough for all the content</li>
	<li>The icons down the bottom of the page may be a little obtuse.</li>
</ol>
<div>Let me know what you think.</div>
