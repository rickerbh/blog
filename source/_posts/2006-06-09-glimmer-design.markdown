<div>
<div>has been born.  <a href="http://glimmerdesign.com/">http://glimmerdesign.com</a> is my new business.  It's a web based application company, and we (I) have one application released so far.  It's called <a href="http://gotthegist.co.nz">Got the GiST</a> and it's a tool for managing GST (sales tax) returns to the government in New Zealand.  It's aimed at small and medium businesses.Â 

Fingers crossed I can pull it all off.  Time for some marketing I think.
