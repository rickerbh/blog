<div><div><p>Back from my shoe shopping excursion.  My mate Kurt said I should go down to <a href="http://www.shoescience.co.nz/">Shoe Science</a> and get fitted for a pair of shoes.  It&#8217;s quite interesting how they fit you.  They have this camera and a DVD recorder, and a little running track.  You run up and down the track 3 times, and they record your legs running.  Then you watch the video, and check out the ankle movement.  They then can choose a shoe that will correct your ankle roll.  The theory is that the shoes you get from there will be biomechanically correct, and they will lower the chance of injury.<br />Anyway, I found <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/prod.php?k=23645&#38;p=BSI41166">some shoes</a> that corrected my ankle roll, and they didn&#8217;t have the perfect size for me.  They are ordering them in, so on Tuesday (or perhaps even Monday afternoon) I&#8217;ll have some new running shoes that no longer hurt me.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1878114">buy proper running shoes</a></div></div>
