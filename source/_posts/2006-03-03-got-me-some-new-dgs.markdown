<div><div><p>I got one of the girls I work with to come out sunglasses shopping with me last week.  Went down to a parallel importer on queen street, and they didn&#8217;t have anything I was interested in.  I wanted some more fashionable glasses, not sports styled glasses.  I already have some adidas ones, but I felt I needed a change.</p>	<p>So, into Sunglass Hut on Queen Street, have a look around, and I get very confused.  I found it very difficult to determine which glasses are for which sex &#8211; there are some obvious female-themed glasses, but the mens ones are more difficult to distinguish.  So, I speak to the clerk, and she gets me out quite a few pairs.</p>	<p>Long story short, the first pair I try on are the best.  <a href="http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/D_G-lbmfph/lb.html">D&#38;G 2075&#8217;s</a>.</p>	<p><img src="http://www.framesdirect.com/cdimages_lg/DandG_2075S.jpg" alt="" /></p>	<p>Nice.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2338745">find new sunglasses</a></div></div>
