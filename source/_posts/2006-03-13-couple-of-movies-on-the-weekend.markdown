I watched Last Days and The Dinner Game (aka Le DÃƒ®ner de cons).

Last Days was the most boring movie I've ever watched.  Most boring EVER.  Boring.  I was so bored.

The Dinner Game was much better.  I watched the french with english subtitles version.  It was a bit of a cheesy comedy, but clever cheesy.  I really enjoyed it actually.

Jenna claims that she didn't add Last Days to the list, that it was an addition from me.  Perhaps that's right.  I can't blame her for wasting 97 minutes of my life.
