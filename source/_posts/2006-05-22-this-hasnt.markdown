<div><div><p>been going very well for me at all.  I&#8217;m moving out of the country soon, and have got rid of virtually everything in my house.  Including, pots, pans, plates, cups, cutlery, fridge + freezer.  So, I can only make food here that I</p>	<ol>	<li>add hot water to</li>		<li>grill</li>		<li>bake</li>	</ol>	<p>And for the last 2, that&#8217;s as long as they come in their own containers.</p>	<p>I&#8217;ve been eating out for around 3 weeks now, I&#8217;ve been trying to eat healthy, asian style meals with heaps of vegetables, no added salt or fat, but I&#8217;m just not sure of the nutritional value of them.  Oh well, should be back on track next week I think.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1827251">Eat better</a></div></div>
