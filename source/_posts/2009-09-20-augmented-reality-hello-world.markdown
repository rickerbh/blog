I've recently discovered augmented reality. After I saw my first "virtual business card" application I was hooked.  I've been doing a lot of reading and experimenting with software over the past 2 days, and have got <a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/" target="_blank">ARToolkit</a> working here.  Here are some shots of the obligitory "cube over marker" demo.  I would post a video, but my screen capture software and AR software = a really poor frame rate and substandard video :-(

Next up, something more substantial.
