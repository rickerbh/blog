<div><div><p>AMC convinced me to do this on my last night in Auckland.  We went uptown from my hotel and found a games arcade that had photo booths &#8211; the ones where you can overlay graphics and text on your photos.  The instructions on the machine were poor, and we ended up getting something we didn&#8217;t intend to &#8211; we got photos on card.</p>	<p>We really wanted sticker photos, so we went to another video games arcade that had like 25 of these big photo machines &#8211; it was crazy.  We couldn&#8217;t figure out which ones of the big machines would make stickers, but we found 3 smaller machines by the entrance, and took 2 sets of sticker photos.</p>	<p>The medals reference was for another machine we saw &#8211; it would etch your photo onto a piece of metal &#8211; I assume to be used as a keyring or something&#8230;</p>	<p>They are super-cheesy photos.  Great.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=3412990">take crazy pictures with someone in a photobooth</a></div></div>
