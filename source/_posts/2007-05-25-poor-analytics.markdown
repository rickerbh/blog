<a href="http://www.boots.com/">Boots</a>!  What are you doing?

I'm a dude.  I don't want to look <em>lovely</em>.

This really irks me.  As part of my day job I perform IT system selections.  One thing I know a little bit about is BI/campaign management/analytics software.  It isn't too hard to run a marketing campaign, and choose your messages based on the gender of the person you are trying to entice to purchase your products.  Another option is choosing a subset of customers to market to - <strong>SELECT * FROM customers WHERE gender = 'f'</strong> might have excluded me.

Companies that don't utilise their data well are just wasting an incredible important resource, and potentially creating a bad customer experience.
