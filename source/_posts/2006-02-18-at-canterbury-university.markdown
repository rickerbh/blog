<div><div><p>I had to do a <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/UCCISWebOld/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=COSC122&#38;year=1998">first year paper</a> in data structures and algorithms.  I scraped through, I just could not &#8220;get it&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve decided that Haskell (Hugs is what we used) is not going to conquer me.  I am going to relearn and understand functional programming.</p>	<p>Now the slacker kids get to use Java.  They aren&#8217;t <em>forced</em> to learn the joy that is functional/declarative programming.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2220058">learn haskell</a></div></div>
