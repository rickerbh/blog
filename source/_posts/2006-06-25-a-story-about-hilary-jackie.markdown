I knew of Jacqueline du PrÃƒ© from her music, I'm a big fan of the cello.  I did not however know of the tragic story of her life.  I don't know how much of the movie has been dramatised, but she was a brilliant cellist who was cut down way too early.

I really recommend this movie.  I thought it was fantastic.
