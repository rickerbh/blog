Now, I don't actually read or subscribe to Martha Stewarts web site, but I found on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> a link to a <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/page.jhtml?type=content&amp;id=channel5540059&amp;rsc=010107_hpdl1_C&amp;xsc=SC4756">Wall Calendar</a>.  This is a calendar that you paint on you wall with blackboard paint (mixed with a number of greys), so you can write on it.  I want to have a blackboard door or area in my kitchen in my new house, so I can write notes up, but a wall calendar is such an excellent idea.
