<div><div><p>I had a bad experience with a plumber.  In short, he replaced parts of a hot water cylinder that weren&#8217;t busted, and left me with no hot water after working at my place for over 4 hours.  I&#8217;ve been getting statements from them saying it&#8217;s overdue, I&#8217;ve called them twice, and they&#8217;ve said both times they&#8217;ll get the manager to call me back, and they haven&#8217;t.  So, I&#8217;m writing a letter, with the help of my <a href="http://annemareec.43people.com/">editing staff</a> and I&#8217;ll get my parents to post it (as I&#8217;m no longer in the country).</p>	<p>Anyway, if you are in NZ I recommend <strong>AGAINST</strong> using <a href="http://www.mrplumber.co.nz/">Mr Plumber</a></p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=3889330">tell mr plumber where to shove his bill</a></div></div>
