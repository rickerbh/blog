AMC and I went to Amsterdam to celebrate my birthday this year.  It's an interesting place.  I found the whole experience odd, but enjoyable.  It's a strange mix of people there - I guess we were there for the weekend, so perhaps got the weekend crowds.  There were lots of stags/hens parties, all stumbling around the red light district, being enticed into BananaBar (or whatever it was called) for some live action, and the coffeehuis situation is a bit odd too.  It's quite fun seeing people totally off their chops stumbling around the streets.

So, what did we do/see?
<ul>
	<li>Heineken Brewery Tour<br /><img id="image177" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/dsc01728.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Heineken Brewery" /></li>
	<li>Red Light District</li>
	<li>Flea Market</li>
	<li>Van Gogh Museum</li>
	<li>Sex Museum</li>
	<li>Torture Museum (not worth it!)</li>
	<li>Canal Cruise</li>
	<li>Drank Beer</li>
	<li>Ate Indonesian (cause it's frickin' hard to find in the UK)</li>
	<li>Saw a really funny looking little car<br /><img id="image180" src="http://hamishrickerby.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/dsc01793.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Funny Car" /></li>
</ul>

There are lots of bikes there.

And I bought a new hat.
