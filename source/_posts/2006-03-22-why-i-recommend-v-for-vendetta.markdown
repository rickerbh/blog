Good movie.  Yet again, I got to go to a preview before official release in New Zealand through a guy at work (his partner is the Marketing Manager [or something] for Village Roadshow â€“ so I often get free tix to sneak previews).  I really did enjoy this.  It's got some cool special effects, I like the concept of the story (deep down I'm sure there's a conspiracy theorist/activist in me somewhere), and of course, it's got <a href="http://www.43people.com/profile/view/97400">Natalie Portman</a> in it.
