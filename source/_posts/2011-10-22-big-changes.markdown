Big changes are taking place. My wife [@mrsrickerby](http://twitter.com/mrsrickerby) and I have decided that we are going to move to Australia. Well, not so much that we are going to move to Australia, more like we *are* moving. At the start of December 2011. To a city I have never been to before. [Melbourne](http://g.co/maps/2k9vr).

The rationale behind the move is that we would both like to be closer to our families. We're both from New Zealand, and the UK for us was only ever temporary. We've been here 5 years, and it's time to move on. We've had a good time here. [Reading](http://g.co/maps/knxa2) is the place I've spent the 3rd most time in, only being beaten by [Auckland](http://g.co/maps/kyvuq) (if you count living in a hotel in [Sydney](http://g.co/maps/wbjmb) for 9 months as living in Auckland), and [Christchurch](http://g.co/maps/yrk8s) where I spent just over 21 years.

My wife has a job organised there, but I don't. I'm a telco consultant, and have worked for myself for the past 18 months or so doing this, as well as developing iOS applications for myself and the occasional client. I really like software product development, and would like to do more of this. Melbourne isn't the best city in Australia for what I do (Sydney would be a more sensible choice for my work), but it's probably time for a change, or at least, a commitment to try something I've wanted to do for a long time.

More soon.
