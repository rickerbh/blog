That's how I found it.  The album left me feeling quite empty.  Like I hadn't really been listening to anything.  The only track I actually enjoyed off the album was â€œBlack Girlâ€, and I think the reason for that was because I really like the Nirvana acoustic version â€œWhere did you sleep last nightâ€ from their Unplugged album.

I was recommended this album by a friend, and she's not usually wrong about music that I'll like.

I was quite disappointed.
