<div><div><p>hehehe.  So, since I&#8217;ve joined head office here in the UK I&#8217;ve had 3 trips away.</p>	<p>2x Dusseldorf (becoming old hat)<br />1x Malta &#8211; that was a good trip.  Got to meet some new people, discuss some good technology, and got to go to a new place.  With the addition of this (and my recent trip to Sweden as well) I&#8217;ve now seen <a href="http://www.listsofbests.com/list/7915/compare/rickerbh">13% of Europe</a>.  Got to get that up tho!</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1997535">Travel the world with my work</a></div></div>
