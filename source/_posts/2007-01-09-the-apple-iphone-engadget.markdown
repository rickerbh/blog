How about that.  The rumours were right.  At MacWorld today: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/">The Apple iPhone</a>

It looks like it will be supporting Wifi, EDGE, camera, GSM, iTunes and has a camera (if you look at the screen shots carefully).  It DOESN'T mention any 3G service, so it looks like video calling will be out, and I assume the camera is on the back (which means it'd be not so cool for video - it's good to have picture in picture so you can ensure you're actually in frame).

I do like the screen size, and the fact that it's touch screen.  Well, I'm actually torn on that - touch screens have a habit of getting very messy, and I'd be concerned about the scratchability.  But all in all it looks like a very sexy device.

Any word on availability???
