I just watched this movie.  Enjoyable.  Again, I didn't know what I was getting myself in for.  I knew it was going to be black and white, but that's about it.  I found the first couple of scenes to be a bit odd.  I quite liked the scene with Jack and Meg White and the Tesla Coil, but my favourite had to be RZA, GZA (of Wu Tang fame) and Bill Murray.  I thought that was hilarious.  I also quite enjoyed the tie ins from scenes to other scenes.

My favourite quotes â€“ please forgive me if I don't get them 100% â€“ it is from memory:
<ul>
	<li>Why don't you quit?  I ain't no f'n quitter.</li>
 
	<li>It's like when you can't afford something its really expensive, and when you can afford something it's free.</li>
 
	<li>It's a great place to visit, and an even nicer place to leave.</li>
 </ul>
 

There were also some beautiful shots.  I really enjoyed quite a few of the shots of the actors by themselves.

 

Jenna also added â€œ4 Roomsâ€ to <a href="http://rickerbh.tadalist.com/lists/public/186249">the list</a>.
