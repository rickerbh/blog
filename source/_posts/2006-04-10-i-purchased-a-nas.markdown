<div><div><p>...on the weekend.  Quite a good one I think (good price point)</p>	<p><img src="http://images.trademe.co.nz/photoserver/med/59/12920659.jpg" alt="" /></p>	<p>So, at the moment all my media is being transferred over to it, then I&#8217;m reformatting my 200Gb HD into HSFS, and moving the DVDs that I have back over to it.  Then I&#8217;ll have a dedicated music server on my NAS, and my movie drive as a portable disk.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2348711">clean up my hard drive</a></div></div>
