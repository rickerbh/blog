</a>
Peter Cooper over at <a href="http://rubyinside.com">rubyinside.com</a> has recently blogged about <a href="http://scrubyt.org/">scRUBYt</a> - a new ruby based web scraping toolkit.

It looks super-powerful.

Basically, you define an extractor, which can pull HTML (even including posting form data, such as product searches), click on links, pull content from the page and create XML with it.

What I particularly like about this is now this gives developers the ability to <em>very simply</em> include content from sites that aren't mashup-friendly (ie, REST or SOAP APIs).  I mean, it was of course possible before, but this just seems so much easier.  No-ones content is safe!
