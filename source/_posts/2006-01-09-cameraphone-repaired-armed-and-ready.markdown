<div><div><p>I got my Nokia 6230i Cameraphone back today.  It had been at the repairshop.  I&#8217;ve reconfigured it so that I can send pictures I take with it wirelessly via GPRS to flickr.  <br />I can take good looking pictures (well, 1.3MP &#8211; better than my old VGA cameraphone) whereever I am.  Now, I&#8217;ve just got to start using it&#8230;</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1827358">Take more pictures</a></div></div>
