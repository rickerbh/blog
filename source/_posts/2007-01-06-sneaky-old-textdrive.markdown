Well, TextDrive have just confused me!  There is an apache_module (I think) that checks for offending strings that are sent to the textdrive servers.  I wanted to (in my last post) explain that I used "wget" to get the RSS feed from my blogspot account, but I figured out that they didn't like me using the phrase "wget" in my previous post.

Explanation (kind of) is available <a href="http://clug.org/?q=node/130">here</a>.  Short answer is that the phrase "wget" (minus the quotes) followed by a space is not allowed.  Crazy, huh?
