<div><div><p>quite well I felt.  They have already organised for me to speak to the &#8220;Group Resourcing and Talent Management&#8221; (of course, I am talent!) liason again.  He started asking about visas and everything, I was a bit unclear about my situation.  I found out as I was walking home that my grandfather was born in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/103029">South Africa</a> (I always thought he was born in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/104704">Newcastle</a>).  However, because of South Africas relatively late independence, and a change in immigration law in the UK, I might still be able to swing a visa thru him or my father.  Anyway, the company indicated that it would be no issue to hook me up with one.  I just can&#8217;t be in the country when they file the application.</p>	<p>Fingers crossed!  Looks promising!</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1872113">get a job in europe</a></div></div>
