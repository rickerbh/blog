<div>by Steven D. Levitt</div>
<div>Interesting book.  I was quite impressed with the way that the authors managed to present economic concepts with examples and language that are very laymen friendly.  I was also impressed with the analysis that Steven Levitt had performed into reasons for dropping crime â€“ I generally like stories of people busting conventional theories, and finding new ways to explain things.  Anyway â€“ good book.  I recommend it.</div>
