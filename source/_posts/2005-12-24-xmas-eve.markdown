Went to Jennas place today.  Her friend Amy who was up in Christchurch from Timaru came over.  We headed to the <a href='http://www.thedux.co.nz/'>Dux</a> and caught up with another friend of theirs, Becky.  The dux was so busy - completely packed out.  Only stayed there for one beer, then we went back to Jennas place for more drinks.  Eventually a whole stack of people came over, we polished off bottles of Whiskey, Vodka, and Gin.  Met a bunch of new, fun people which was great.  I'll post the pics to <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/rickerbh/'>flickr</a>.<p>Got to bed at about 3:30am - 4am - not quite sure really.  I got up at around 7:30am to get my ass back to my parents place for Xmas.  The roads were dead that early on Xmas day.<p>Had a great night, but paid for it on Xmas day.
