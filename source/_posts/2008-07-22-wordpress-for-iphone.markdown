This morning I saw on the iTunes store that Automattic had their wordpress iPhone application released. I promptly downloaded and installed it onto my new phone.  I'm writing this entry on it now and it seems pretty good. You can upload photos but I think writing HTML will be a bit of a pain, but for a quick blog post it seems to do the job. I say if you have an iPhone and a wordpress based blog then this is a good application to have, and the price can't be beat.

Update: uploading a photo causes my iPhone to crash. I'll try again :-S Hmmm, it worked that time.

Update 2: now it tells me I have an invalid image, and it won't upload it. I hope they get that sorted soon. No images for you this post sorry.
