Opening hours. I want them on every physical stores, restaurants, and bars website. They do good store locators in the UK, I guess it's because postcodes are everywhere, everyone knows them and they identify a very small area (a street, or part of a street). How come stores, when thinking about the data on their store locator, don't include opening hours. Address and phone are always there, but when I'm going home on the train I want to know if my local stores will still be open when I get there.

Oh well, no spending at that particular store tonight.
