Back in the late 90's I took COSC 122 at the University of Canterbury. We had to learn functional programming as part of that course - HUGS (it's based on Haskell 98). It never really clicked with me - for some reason my brain would just not understand functional programming.

I've always regretted that I never "got it". It's time to fix that regret. 

To (re)learn Haskell, I'm using [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com), and to ensure that I "get it", I'm working my way through the [Haskell 99 Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions).
