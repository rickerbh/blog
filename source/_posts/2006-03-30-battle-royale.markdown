Ah, the Japanese.  Great electronics, crazy english translation, even crazier movies â€“ well, that's not usually true, but Battle Royale is certainly one of the crazier Japanese movies I've seen.  It has more blood that Zatoichi, and it certainly more Japanese (although that's an odd comment, given Zatoichi was about a Samurai â€“ hmmm),  Anyway, I enjoyed this movie â€“ it's certainly action packed.  The only part which annoyed me a bit is some of the dialogue â€“ it's very stereotypical of what I would expect Japanese early teen conversation to be â€“ but I guess the movie is about Japanese teens.  Maybe I was expecting too much in the dialogue front â€“ or perhaps it was a case of engrish on the translation.  Anyway, I liked it.

And now there's only 46 left on the list.
