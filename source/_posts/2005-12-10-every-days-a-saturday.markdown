Had lunch with my friend Brodie today...  We went to De Fontein at Mission Bay.  Had a good talk about what's going on with me.  It was nice to see her.  I think when I leave NZ I'll go to Sydney for a couple of days and catch up with <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/37703201@N00/39129236/in/set-861835/'>Matt</a>, <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/37703201@N00/39127195/in/set-861835/'>Brodie</a>(the Matt in that pic ain't the Matt I reference before) and  <a href='http://www.jeremyansley.com'>J</a>.  Will be nice to see all of them before I leave this part of the world.<p>Good progress on the job front last week.  Promising feedback from a couple of people.  Fingers crossed.<p>And, tonight was "Christmas in the Park" here in Auckland.  I didn't go, but I still got to see the fireworks.  From my place I could see them - they were quite impressive.  Couldn't see all of the fireworks tho, only the ones that mattered :-)  (the big, impressive fireworks).
