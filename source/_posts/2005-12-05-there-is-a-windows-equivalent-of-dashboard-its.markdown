There is a windows equivalent of Dashboard.  It's called Konfabulator.  And before I get any mac nerds telling me how different Dashboard is, and how dare I compare it to Konfabulator - I don't care.

And it has a family guy RQG - well, at least it has Stewie - but he's my favourite character anyway.

You can download  <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/download">Konfabulator</a> here.

Enjoy!
