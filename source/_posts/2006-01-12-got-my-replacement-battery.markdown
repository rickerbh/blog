<div><div><p>My 3rd Gen ipod is just over 2 years old now.  I&#8217;ve abused the poor battery a lot, and now it has a life of about 1 hour.  I went on <a href='http://www.trademe.co.nz'>http://www.trademe.co.nz</a> and found a replacement battery kit for a 850mAh battery (apparently 30% more capacity than OEM battery).  the kit comes with a battery, instructions, and 2 nylon tools for prying the thing open (so you don&#8217;t scratch the case).  I&#8217;m going to replace the battery tonight I think &#8211; of course that depends if I go out for drinks after work.  I&#8217;ll be documenting the replacement on my blog I think.  I&#8217;ll keep you all posted.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=1873205">figure out how to replace this fucking iPod battery!</a></div></div>
