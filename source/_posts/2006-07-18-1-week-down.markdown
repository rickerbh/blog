<div><div><p>I&#8217;ve been living in Newbury just over a week now.  The place seems alright.  The rumors about it that I had heard were much worse than it&#8217;s turned out to be.  It&#8217;s an old market town in the countryside in england, and it&#8217;s just as you expect.  There are some quite picturesque parts of it, there&#8217;s lots of pubs, the bars and nightclubs are quite average, and everyone here seems to work for Vodafone.  Food seems expensive, the Thai here is awful, I&#8217;m yet to try some fish n&#8217; chips and a curry, but I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;re good.  I would like to spend more time here, I&#8217;ve met some good people, but I need to find a place to live more permanently, and it sadly won&#8217;t be Newbury.</p></div><div>See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43places.com/people/progress/rickerbh?on=2858488">Newbury</a></div></div>
