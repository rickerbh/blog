I just installed the <a href="http://verselogic.net/projects/wordpress/wordpress-openid-plugin/">VerseLogic wordpress OpenID plugin</a>.  This means that you guys (if you have an OpenID already) don't have to explicitly register on my site to comment.  You can just log in with your OpenID, and an account will be created here for you.  No more passwords!

You can get a free OpenID at <a href="http://myopenid.com/">http://myopenid.com/</a>

To find out more about OpenID, check it all out <a href="http://openid.net/">here</a>.
