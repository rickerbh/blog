I've updated Wordpress, AND migrated my two blogs together to be one, again.

I've also tried to support the existing feeds - so I've got a couple of permanent redirects in the .htaccess files to sort them out. Â So, if your feeds don't work anymore, your crappy feedreader doesn't support the HTTP specification correctly.
